What you can do with this script?

```
  You can jail players to prison or to lockup.
  Escape is possible! Your friends can try to release you, but police officers get alarm from it.
  Time is in minutes, not seconds.
  Optimized, used json.
  Full support to script and includes new updates.
  Permissions, can’t jail people without that you are admin or police.
  Possible to configure it yourself. Also possible to add your own webhooks (discord).
  Your sentence continues, when you join back to server.
  Cool animations.
```
